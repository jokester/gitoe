- find a way, to play with huge repo
    - partial-fetching from latest commits
    - -> partial-rendering of DAG ?

- make a HUGE virtual canvas
    - a fabric.Group with all objects inside?
    - how to coord
    - how to scroll

- visualize refs
    - ref -> commit
    - ref -> ref

- gitoe.Historian

- ensure Gitoe.rb gives all commits

- layout commits in better way
    - fake-node, to reduce overlap
    - less crossing
